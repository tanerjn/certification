# Plesk for Web

Now read this: 

> Plesk for Linux uses the Apache HTTP Server (http://httpd.apache.org/) for hosting websites. Apache itself does not operate with websites; it manages virtual hosts, that is web resources identified either by an IP address or a host name. When you create a site, Plesk adds a new virtual host to Apache so that the site becomes available through the web server.

Does it not sound genious? Yes, this new tool I came across has been around recently and I think it might be  the unbeatable tool in term of web hosting competing with CPanel and others. Plesk has been sold to Parallels which is known as the leading virtualization company in MacOs world, which makes Plesk one level higher above all others. 

Few benefits I've observed: 

- Eye pleasing dashboard
- Extension rich(seriously)
- Can publish and demonstrate simple stuff without domain name for the hosting customer.
- Easy settings & configuration plus super quick! 


Cons: 

- Need to upgrade limits manually. Original setup parameters is at bare minimum. (Though this being a con is debatable)
- Only tested on Debian, not sure if compatible with other OSes..


You don't want to go through all your CI/CD to check simple changes? They hooked one of my git repos in second and also possible to edit files from within. Overall go out and check.. (Would you mind if I get a share for advertising them.. Bbbrhh :-)
