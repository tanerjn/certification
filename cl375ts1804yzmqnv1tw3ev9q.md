# What is Hybrid Cloud and why it's getting popular?

Almost 20 years ago AWS started public cloud journey with the initiative of Andy Jassy and Allan Vermeulen inside Amazon to provide service for 3rd Party sellers like Marks & Spencer to build their selling platforms within Amazon, this was named *Merchant.com* back then. Initial team's focus was really just to provide the landscape so farmers could jog the wheel. 

As you would assume nobody really cared about complex things such as scaling or load balancing. But even without these a simple site would take up to 5 months to provision compute, storage and database resources. The job was relatively easy but not quite efficient or you say *fun*.

As the demand increases, this boutique storage shop started not to be providing in time. And they decided to scale. Yeah!! So the ins and outs of the business has shown so much benefit other friends in the village also wanted to create their farms to attract other nice farmers to feed and harvest at their bay. 

With the entrance of Microsoft, IBM, Oracle and Google et al. today market has size reported as 410 billion $. Keep breathing please.. Yes, let's continue. And moreover, this number has jumped %20 just in 2022 to 494 billion $. And more..moreover, it is expected to have size x4 in next years due to the digital transformation. Insane right? 

Now, the cake does not only come with the nice candles. There is always risk to start fire by blowing them. This reason, smart companies started to share the load these days with their B2B partners. No wonder, right?!. 

OpenStack has been leading on-prem cloud in this area. And recently IBM acquiring RedHat (which owns OpenStack and OpenShift) giving signals that what we know cloud is going to change its functioning for giant application providers. They will gracefully have to retrograde their ideas and and maybe start choosing on which scooter has better maneuverability inside data center..

This what I can foresee is going to keep demand high for people who are able to tackle hardware issues by not side affecting other parts of systems. Also demand on the utilization of *hybrid* cloud world.
