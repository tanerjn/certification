# Using Vultr

Since AWS never disappoints to surprise with unexpected billing, this time I wanted to try something boutiqe and really 'just' what I need. After a quick search, I was amazed how Vultr chose to offer their services and all kinds of machine images. It took me literally 30 seconds to deploy a machine with my SSH key installed. 

Pros: 

- Great dashboard, not complicated and slow like AWS, GCP kind of.
- Multiple region
- Super quick
- Intiutive workflow
- OS & App rich
- Proper pricing

Cons: 
- I did not notice any.

Feeling tired of AWS's complexity, unexpected billing, new services, change on services each day? I think you may be a happy citizen using Vultr or other kind of boutique VPS providers. 

Ps: The IP has changed, don't try to hack. :-)
