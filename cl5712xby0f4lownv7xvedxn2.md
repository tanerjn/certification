# Python..anywhere? anytime?

If you'r not alergic to have the midfix in your domain, pythonanywhere offers a very straightforward deployment without any cost. Still curious how they handle the backend, or can I get super rich with limited 512 MB, overall great tool for prototyping!

Pros: 
- Deployment
- Maintenance. 

Cons: 

- No CI enhancement
