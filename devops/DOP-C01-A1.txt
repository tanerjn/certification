AWS DevOps Pro
- Publish application artefacts to S3 bucket and create VPC endpoint, asking IAM to EC2 so roles can read from S3.
- Zero downtime deployments: CloudFormation:UpdatePolicy, new application LoadBalancer and AutoScaling group.
- S3 bucket sprawl alerts: New pipeline in different region for each project to bypass the service limits for S3 buckets in single region.
- Create hotfix branch from the master branch. Trigger the development pipeline from the hot fix branch. Use AWS CodeBuild to do a content scan and run unit tests. Add manual approval stage that merges the hot fix branch into master.
- Install an Amazon CloudWatch agent on the EC2 instance, and configure the agent to send the application logs and operating system metrics to CloudWatch. Enable RDS Enhanced Monitoring and modify the RDS instance to publish database logs to CloudWatch logs.
- EC2 vulnerability check: Amazon Inspector to detect vulnerabilities on the EC2 instances. Install CloudWatch Agent to capture system logs and record them via Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
- Create and use CodeDeploy to code update EC2 fleer. Select Application Load Balancer. Modify Lambda function to build a single application package to be shared by all instances. Use AWS CodeDeploy instead of AWS System Manager to update the code on the EC2 fleet.
- Use DynamoDB Accelerator to cache repeated read requests to DynamoDB and Amazon CloudFront to cache images stored in S3. (Because 90 percent are duplicate read requests)
- 9 EC2 instances on third party API: Install the CloudWatch Logs agent on all instances to push application logs to CloudWatch logs using metric filter, and number of failures and triggers if metric reaches 10 errors per 1 minute period.
- Create and use an AWS CodeDeploy application and deployment group to deploy code updates to the EC2 fleet. Select the Application Load Balancer for the deployment group. Modify the Lambda function to build single application package to be shared by all instances. Use AWS CodeDeploy instead of AWS Systems Manager to update the code on the E2 fleet.
- Use DynamoDB Accelerator to cache repeated read requests to DynamoDB and Amazon CloudFront to cache images stored in S3.
- Install the Amazon CloudWatch logs agent on all instances to push the application logs to CloudWatch logs use a metric filter to generate a custom CloudWatch metric that records the number of failures and triggers a CloudWatch alarm if the custom metric reaches 10 errors in a 1 minute period.
