802.11 MGMT Frame
1.193 Gateway 1.200/26 Network Id 1.255 Broadcast ID 00:0C:22:83:79:A3 MAC 00:0C:22 NIC Vendor
BUM traffic: Unknown destination of MAC address is received Layer 2 floods packets to all ports except the receiveing port in the given VLAN.
Correct subnet mask for /30 subnet: 255.255.255.252.
Private range of IPv4 addresses Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255. Class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255. Class C 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
Class B can communicate without the need to access to the internet.
unique-local: does provide connection between subnets and can not route to internet.
Ipv6 FF00::/8 Send packets to group addresses multicast. FF00::10 link-local addresses. Link local addresses only used for communication within the local network (automatic address configuration, neighbor discovery, router discovery, and other routing protocols.
Late collisions: one side of the connection is configured half duplex, cable length exceeded.
Cisco Wireless LAN Controller: Eliminates the need to configure each access point individually.
If a monitored port exceeds the syslog message is issued, maximum administrative value for power, the port is shutdown and err-disabled.
Frame flooding: Frames are sent to every port on the switch in the same VLAN except from the originating port.
Private IP addresses ensures companies to use same IPs without conflict. Class C
Enable SLAAC on the interface: Global Unicat IPv6
2.4 ghz has 11 channels, 5ghz has 45 channels. Overlapping cells are configured to use nonoverlapping channels. For maximum throguhput, the WLC is configured to dynamically set adjacent access points to the channel.
Differences optical-fiber and copper: Glass core component is encased in a cladding, Light is transmitted through the core of the fiber.
WLC(Wireless Lan Controller): Access point has the ability to connect any switch.
Multicast FF00::/12
Global Unicast: 2000::/3, 2001::3/3, 2002::4, 2001:db8::/32
Link Local Unicast: FE80::/10 -- FE80:: FEBF::
Unique Local Unicast: FC00/7 -- FC00:: FDFF::
Loopback::1/128
Two descriptions of three tier network: Distribution layer 2 and Layer 3 technologies, network core is designed to maintain continuous connectivity.
Global unicast is publicly routable.
When EUI-64 is generated: Seventh bit of the original MAC address of the interface is inverted. Which is the last 4 character of IPv6. fe80::8013:1fff:fe68:b040::8013:1FFF:FE68:B040
/25 for summary and /27 for each floor.
UDP transmits in stream, TCP transmits in sequence.
2 stations transmits messages in the same time: Late collision.
Collision: in the first 64 bytes, after 64 bits late collison.
Source and destination MAC addresses remain same. 
1, 6, 11 are used to limit collisions on 2.4 GHz channel.
Collision happens at wired network congestion happens at wireless network.
TCP uses checksum, acknowledgement and reransmission. UDP uses acknowledgement only
Enable Band Select t oincrease throughtput 5Ghz network reduce collision.

Ports: FTP TCP 20, 21 TFTP UDP 69
       SSH - TCP 22   SNMP UDP 161
	   SMTP TCP25   DHCP UDP 67
       Telnet TCP 23 RIP UDP 520

MAC addres of broadcast frame ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

Physical addresses are mac addresses allow communication between different devices on the same network, uniquely identify devices at layer 2.

Connection Oriented: SMTP, SSH, FTP. Connectionless: TFTP, VoIP, SNMP

Preamble: notify that traffic is coming. 

Router acts as DHCP client. FastEthernet command IP address dhcp.

OSI layer: Defines network functions at each layer. Facilitates how information travels throughout a network. 

Example MAC: first part defines the manufacturer second defines the hardware

6 to 4 tunneling you can use to route IPv6 traffic over an IPv4 infrastructure.

Each interface on a network must be in a different network. Routers are meant to route different networks.

Etablishes a static route to the 172.16.3.9 network.

Ipv4 benefits: can be sassigned to devices without internet, less costly than public IP.

UDP has lower overhead, UDP has checksums to verify the integrity of application data.

Implement privte IPv4: Conserve IPv4 address, Reduce the risk of a network securyty breach.

Broadband cable access is prefferred for small office home office arch. DSL, cable, satellite: Internet, VPN dat fransfer through internet.

Dual-home branches, dynamic routing are to help a business scalability and reliability for the network.

Binary pattern: 11111101: Unique ipv6 local address according to RFC. 

Ipv4 privte space enable intra-enterprise communication, conserve global address space.

IP don't but MAC may change during transmisson.

Copper and fiber both provide minimal interruption to services being hot swappable. 

SRV: Handles requests from multiple workstations at the same time. Runs applications to send and retrieve data that make requests

Collision: wired congestion: wireless. 
Enforcing route policies are enforced in a collapsed two tier architecture.

Primary function of layer 3 device: P, D, [N], T, S, P, A :: N = Pass traffic between different networks. 

Core: Provide uninterrupted fwd service, ensure timely data between layers.

Avoid co-channel congestion at 2.4 GHz. differnet nonoverlapping channels

Each AP operate in their channel. Neighbouring APs should not use same channel, need to use multiple non-overlapping channel or co-channel interfrence which slows down.

Layer 2 switch: moves packets within VLAN, makes forwarding based on the MAC of a packet.
Layer 3 switch: all packet forwarding between intermediate routers.
