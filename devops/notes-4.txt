The main difference between a packet and a frame is the association with the OSI layers. While a packet is the unit of data used in the network layer, a frame is the unit of data used in the OSI model's data link layer. A frame contains more information about the transmitted message than a packet.

FRAME vs PACKET

Automation and Programability:
Two fundamentals of virtualization: allow logical network devices to move traffic between virtual machines and the rest of the network. allow multiple operating systems and applications to run independently on one physical server.

Cisco DNA Center gather data from the network: Network devices use different services like SNMP, syslog, streaming telemetry to send data to the controller.


Difference of controller based and traditional: Controller based networks decouple the control plane and the data plane.
