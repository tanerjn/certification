The main difference between a packet and a frame is the association with the OSI layers. While a packet is the unit of data used in the network layer, a frame is the unit of data used in the OSI model's data link layer. A frame contains more information about the transmitted message than a packet.

FRAME vs PACKET

Ipv4: Conserve global address space
      Enable intra enterprise communication

Using SFP(small form factor pluggable): 
      Provide minimal interruption to services by being hot-swappable.

Server: Handles requests from multiple workstations at the same time
        Runs application that send and retrieve data for workstations that make requests

Collapsed core layer: Enforcing routing

Layer 3: Pass traffic between different networks.

Core Layer: Provide uninterrupted forwarding service
            Ensure timely data transfer between layers.

Avoid co-channel congestion: Different nonoverlapping channels.

Software as a service: such as personio, that do not need update and used occasionally.

L2 Switch: Moving packets within a VLAN
           Makes forwarding decisions based on the MAC address of a packet. 

TCP: DNS, HTTP, Telnet
UDP: SMNP, SMTP, RTP

2.4 GHz is used heavily but not 5GHz although it is available. Client Band select

Data: Forwarding remote client/server traffic

SiteA: Interface errors are incrementing.

Longest prefix: will be used by router to reach host.

TFTP: Uses UDP, uses port 69, does not requiere user authentication.
FTP: Uses TCP, Uses port 20,21, provides reliability

Frame Check Sequence: Input errors, CRC.

802.11: Management

A leaf switch can be added with connections to every spine switch. 

FF02::1 and FF02:2 multicast groups are joined.

Interface e0/0 description to XX-AXXX:XXXX ip address 209.165.201.2 255.255.255.252

Reason of malfunctioning: It uses broadcast IP.

Communication between subnets: link-local(FC00::7) can not route to internet.
							  uniue local can be routed to internet.

FF00::/8 IPv6 multicast.


E: If monitored port exceeds the maximum administrative value for power, the port is shutdown and err disabled.

Global unicast: SLAAC Enabling

Between optical-fiber and copper cabling: Light is transmitted through the core of the fiber 
                                         Glass core component is encased in a cladding.
CAPWAP: Access point has the ability to link to any switch in the network, assuming connectivity to WLC.

Distribution layer runs L2 and L3 technologis. 
Network core is designed to maintain continuous connectivity when devices fail.

Global unicast is publicly routable.

EUI 64 address: Seventh bit of the original MAC address of the interface is inverted.

Spine and leaf: Each device is seperated by the same number of hops.

Late collision occurs after 64 bytes received.

TCP: FTP, SMTP, SSH UDP:DHCP, SNMP, TFTP

Broacast frame: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

Preamble acts like doorbell that the data is not noise.

UDP: Less overhead than TCP, the application can use checksums to verify the integrity of application data


Copper and fiber interfaces provide minimal interruption to services by being hot swappable.

Collapsed core: enforcing routing policies

Core layer: Provide uninterrupted forwarding service
		    Ensure timely data transfer between layers.

Anycast IPv6 address is similar to a unicast address but is assigned to multiple devices on the same network at the same time?

Private IPv4 used without tracking. 

Router should be configured with the last usable IP on the network.

IP address that is reachable only from internal network: link-local.

Requieremen for nonoverlapping: frequency range

Anycast: assigned to more than one, used exc. by non-host
Multicast: provides on to many, derived from ff00:8
